                    <p>Alzheimer's was first discovered in 1906 by Dr. Alzheimer. As of 2024, researchers estimate that about 55 million people world wide have dementia. Over 90% of that statistic is fulfilled by senior citizens, aged 65 and older. 1 in 3 seniors die with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease kills more people than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. There is contrast in different sexes, races and ethnicities in likeliness to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's: Almost two-thirds of those diagnosed with Alzheimer's are women; Black people are about twice as likely to be diagnosed than White people; Hispanic people are about one-and-a-half more likely to be diagnosed than White people.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are reading this and fit into a statistic that is more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's, it's important to remember that just because a statistic points towards a higher-likeliness of developing the disease, you are not doomed to develop it. There are a multitude of things you can do to significantly lower your chances of being diagnosed, as well as a variety of symptoms to watch out for to begin treatment early and preserve your brain health.</p>

Commonly purple is worn during Alzheimer's Awareness Month in January, or for Alzheimer's day every September 21st, to honour those impacted by the disease. The ribbon serves to increase awareness about the challenges of Alzheimer's and its repercussions.</p>

This type of Alzheimer's has the same effects and symptoms as older patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, studies show that there could be a genetic/familial factor in play. A family history with Alzheimer's disease could be a risk factor in younger people developing early onset Alzheimer's. This type of Alzheimer's could progress rapidly.

                <h2>Caregiver Impacts</h2>
                <p>Due to the abundance of the disease, Alzheimer's affects many patients around the world through cognitive limitations. It's important to note that it is not only the patients who are affected. Due to the disabling symptoms of late-stage Alzheimer's, caregivers, like family members, are necessary for most patients. Patients of Alzheimer's lose the ability to perform basic daily tasks like dressing, eating, or bathing, requiring a lot of time and care. This constant need of assistance can be overwhelming for caregivers, and commonly they face significant emotional, physical, and financial burdens. Approximately 70% of Alzheimer's patients' caretakers feel stressed. The experience of watching a loved one pass away and knowing that nothing can be done to prevent it can be heartbreaking and exhausting. This leads to high rates of caregiver depression, anxiety, and burnout. Additionally, due to the amount of time spent on caregiving, caregivers may need to cut back on work hours or quit their jobs to aid patients, leading to an overall loss of income. If family or friends are not present or able to provide care to patients, the high cost of professional caregiving adds to the financial strain further.</p>

                <h2>Temporary Treatments</h2>
                <p>Make no mistake, Alzheimer's disease is incurable. However, there are treatment methods that mitigate some of its adverse effects and progression. There are a variety of treatment options to slow the inevitable disease progression of Alzheimer's, such as drugs, certain therapies, certain routines, and diets. Different medications and treatments are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease. Common prescriptions for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease are Memantine and Donepezil, which work as regulators and inhibitors to improve attention, memory, reason, language, and the ability to perform simple tasks. Drugs like these work by inhibiting cholinesterase and regulating glutamate, which helps maintain cognitive function by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for learning and memory, and by controlling the activity of glutamate, which plays a key role in neural communication. As the disease advances, the brain continues to deteriorate, and the effectiveness of these treatments tends to diminish over time. Other therapeutic approaches like cognitive therapies and structured daily routines are often recommended to help manage symptoms.</p>
